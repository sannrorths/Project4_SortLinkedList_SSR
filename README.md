#Project4_SortLinkedList_SSR
This java program will take a list of Integer numbers from the scanned input and saves 
them into a Linked List sorted from the smallest to the largest. It shows examples of 
codes reuse and the Java Collections Framework.

The main method will take user's input as integer until user type in a space and "Finsih."
If user inputs are invalid, it will loop back for more user's inputs until user type in "Finish" 
to break out of the program.

The insertSort method will insert numbers into the Linked List and sort it, using indexing.

Instruction on how to run the program.
